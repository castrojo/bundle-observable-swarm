# Observable Swarm

Swarm is a container scheduler that allows the end user to treat a cluster of
units as an elastic runtime to host application containers.

Beats are the core of data shipping in the new Elastic Stack by Elastic Co.
Famous for their ELK stack, these succeed any agents you might be familiar with.

When you mash these two together, you get a nice observable solution for your
containers.

### Filebeat

A lightweight, open source shipper for log file data. As the next-generation
Logstash Forwarder, Filebeat tails logs and quickly sends this information to
Logstash for further parsing and enrichment or to Elasticsearch for centralized
storage and analysis.

### Topbeat

 Topbeat is a lightweight way to gather CPU, memory, and other per-process and
 system wide data, then ship it to Elasticsearch to analyze the results.
